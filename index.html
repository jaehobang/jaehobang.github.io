    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/profile_pic.jpeg" alt="Jaeho Bang" width="300" height="400">
    <p>Hi, my name is Jaeho Bang and I'm an AI Compiler Engineer during the day, Researcher during any other time. </p>
    <p>I've always been passionate about Artificial Intelligence. </p>
    <p>As much as like Artifical Intelligence, I also enjoy exploring the world of investing and learning about new investment strategies.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working or investing, you can usually find me on the tennis court. I've been playing tennis for many years and it's one of my favorite ways to stay active and relieve stress.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this site is two-folds. First, I wanted to share who I am, what I my experiences are at the professional level. Second, I wanted to log and share my findings (AI / investing) to others :)</p>
    
    
    <h2>Experiences</h2>
    <p>I studied Computer Science in graduate school (undergone PhD program for 4.5 years but didn't finish), and Electrical and Computer Engineering / Robotics during undergraduate and master's.</p>
    <p>You can find an extended list of my education and experiences <a href="content/resume.html">Here</a></p>
    
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I am dedicating blog spaces for my two interests: AI and Investing.</p>
