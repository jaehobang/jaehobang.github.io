    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/profile_pic.jpeg" alt="Jaeho Bang" width="300" height="400">
    <p>Hi, my name is Jaeho Bang and I'm an AI Compiler Engineer during the day, Researcher during any other time. </p>
    <p>I've always been passionate about Artificial Intelligence. </p>
    <p>As much as like Artifical Intelligence, I also enjoy exploring the world of investing and learning about new investment strategies.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working or investing, you can usually find me on the tennis court. I've been playing tennis for many years and it's one of my favorite ways to stay active and relieve stress.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this site is two-folds. First, I wanted to share who I am, what I my experiences are at the professional level. Second, I wanted to log and share my findings (AI / investing) to others :)</p>
    
    
    <h2>Experiences</h2>
    <p>I studied Computer Science in graduate school (undergone PhD program for 4.5 years but didn't finish), and Electrical and Computer Engineering / Robotics during undergraduate and master's.</p>
    <p>You can find an extended list of my education and experiences <a href="content/resume.html">Here</a></p>
    
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <h3>Questions that Interest Me</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the neural network architecture and training method of ChatGPT and why is its performance such a significant boost compared to other state-of-the-art (although there is no objective way of judging this)?</li>
        <li>With the advent of ChatGPT and other GPT variations, what type of skills should we humans develop from today and onwards?</li>
        <li>Why is it so hard to beat the performance of index funds? What type of strategies, based on historical data, can we use?</li>
        <li>The Feds have hiked interest rates and now is 5%. What are the possible next steps that the Feds will take? What strategies should we investors should use to maximize gain / minimize loss?</li>
        <li>Which companies are working on the interesting problems and yet making profit?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, you guess it. My interests are AI and Investing.</p>
