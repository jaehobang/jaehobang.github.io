        <p>Hi, my name is Jaeho Bang and I'm an <strong>AI Compiler Engineer</strong> during the day, <strong>Researcher</strong> during any other time.</p>
        <p>I've always been passionate about <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.</p>
        <p>As much as I like Artificial Intelligence, I also enjoy exploring the world of <strong>investing</strong> and learning about new investment strategies.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working or investing, you can usually find me on the <strong>tennis court</strong>. I've been playing tennis for many years and it's one of my favorite ways to stay active and relieve stress.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this site is two-fold: <br>
          <ol>
            <li>To share who I am and my professional experiences.</li>
            <li>To log and share my findings in <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>investing</strong> with others :)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
