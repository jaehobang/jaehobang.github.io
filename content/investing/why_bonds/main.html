				<h3>Definition and Terminology of Bonds</h3>
				<p>A bond is a fixed-income security that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower. The borrower could be a government, corporation, or other entity. In exchange for the loan, the borrower agrees to pay the investor a fixed rate of interest, known as the coupon rate, for a specified period of time. At the end of the term, the borrower repays the principal amount of the loan.</p>
				<p>Some important bond terminology includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Coupon rate:</strong> The fixed rate of interest that the borrower agrees to pay the investor.</li>
					<li><strong>Maturity date:</strong> The date when the borrower must repay the principal amount of the loan.</li>
					<li><strong>Yield:</strong> The rate of return on a bond, taking into account the coupon rate and the bond's market price.</li>
					<li><strong>Bond rating:</strong> A measure of the creditworthiness of the borrower, assigned by credit rating agencies.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Why Investors Should Consider US Treasury Bonds in Times of High Inflation</h3>
				<p>US Treasury bonds are considered a safe haven investment because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. This means that the likelihood of default is low, making US Treasury bonds a relatively low-risk investment.</p>
				<p>In times of high inflation, US Treasury bonds can also provide a hedge against inflation. This is because the coupon rate is fixed, so the investor is guaranteed a fixed rate of return even if inflation rises. This makes US Treasury bonds an attractive option for investors looking for a safe investment with a predictable return.</p>

				<h3>Cautionary Measures When Investing in Bonds</h3>
				<p>While US Treasury bonds are generally considered a low-risk investment, there are still some cautionary measures that investors should take:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Understand the risks:</strong> While US Treasury bonds are considered safe, there is still a risk of default or inflation eroding the value of the investment.</li>
					<li><strong>Diversify:</strong> It's important to diversify your portfolio to reduce risk. This means investing in a variety of different asset classes, not just bonds.</li>
					<li><strong>Consider the impact of interest rates:</strong> When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, so investors need to be aware of the impact of interest rates on their bond investments.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Short vs. Long Maturity Bonds</h3>
				<p>Short maturity bonds typically have a maturity of less than 5 years, while long maturity bonds have a maturity of 10 years or more. Short maturity bonds are less sensitive to changes in interest rates and inflation, but they typically offer a lower yield. Long maturity bonds are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and inflation, but they typically offer a higher yield.</p>
				<p>Investors need to consider their investment goals and risk tolerance when deciding between short and long maturity bonds.</p>

                <p>You can easily generate this list to 2020 using Chat-GPT. Let me know if this is of interest and I will update the table.</p>
                <p>If you compute the table into a graph, it is as follows:</p>
                <img src="graph1.png" alt="Graph">
                <p>If you compute the correlation coefficients between each column, the coefficient between S&P Avg Return and Federal Funds Rate is 0.04.</p>
                <p>If you compute the correlation between Federal Funds rate and Avg inflation rate, it is 0.7.</p>
                <p>Hence, in a situation where inflation is high, but is lowering, Federal Funds Rate will also decrease.</p>
                <p>Since Federal Funds Rate and Bond Price have a negative correlation, we can expect the Bond Price to increase.</p>
                <p>Here is a graphical depiction with regards to 20-year US Treasury Bond price and yields. Although, yields is a bit different from Federal Funds Rate, it will still depict a good picture.</p>
                <img src="graph2.png" alt="Graph">
                <img src="graph3.png" alt="Graph">
                <p>In conclusion, if inflation lowers, dividend yield / federal funds rate will lower, bond price will increase.</p>
                <p>According to the two graphs, we can expect the increase in price to be around 20%.</p>
